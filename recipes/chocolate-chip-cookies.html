    <h3>Chocolate Chip Cookie Ingredients</h3>
    <p>These are the kitchen staples you'll need to make the best chocolate chip cookies of your life:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong>This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda: </strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate chips: </strong>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuts (optional):</strong>Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
