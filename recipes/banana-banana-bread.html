    <h3>Banana Bread Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong>A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown sugar: </strong>Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Bananas:</strong>Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Measurements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 ⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ul> <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ul>
