    <h3>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong>A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown sugar: </strong>Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Bananas:</strong>Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
        </ul>
